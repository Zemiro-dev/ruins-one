# Enemy Structure

CollisionCore
CollisionShield
Sprite
- What are my enemies actually gonna look like? Or is this for basic sphere?
Indicator
- Healthbar? Shield?
Shield
- Need to make a shield logic state thing that can manage the shield health of Entities
AnimationPlayer
- Okay for real now how do I organize this to make it easy? I don't wanna have to recreate stuff and some of these animations should be near copy pastable. Maybe make a default anim pack? Can I do that idk.
Audio
- Probs worth putting the node there. Still need to kinda figure that out but what I have is probs okay for now screw it.
Weapons?
- The cannon has the pivot with projectile marker and cannon body. Enemies need a way to be given a target. Gotta figure out spawning rules vs areas maybe. Make 'start_with_player_as_target' is configurable to ease in scripting?

Enemy collisions aren't right because of the normal I think for the hexagon shields. Need to figure out collisions better via some normal manipulation maybe?
